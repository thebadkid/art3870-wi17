<p>Welcome to my page. This page will continue to grow as time goes on from Web Authoring and hopefully carry on to the future!

  <br><br>I am a current Graphic Design mmajor at California State University, East Bay and hopefully will be graduating by the year of 2018.
  <br><br>Admittingly, the current class is really hard. Especially having to deal with Graphic Design II AND Production Design AND being a full time worker and student, it gave me little to no time to try to finish these projects. With that being said, it is what it is. It's the real world out there ladies and gents. Words for the future: DO NOT TAKE GD II, PRODUCTION DESIGN, AND WEB AUTHORING AT THE SAME TIME. You will perish. The warning has been posted.

  <br><br>Good Luck and Have Fun.
